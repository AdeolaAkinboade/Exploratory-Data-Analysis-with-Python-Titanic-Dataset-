# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-with-Python-Titanic-Dataset-


AIM:

To do Exploratory Data Analysis on the Titanic Data set to answer the following hypothesis on the surivival rate :

HYPOTHESIS:

1. Members in the cheapest passenger class are less likely to survive ,in comparison to othe classes
2.More males ,in comparison to females, are less likely to survive



METHODOLOGY:

Obtained the dataset from The Titanic Challenge on Kaggle
Python and Jupyter were used for this project
Imported necessary libraries (pandas,numpy, seaborn,matplotlib, the Titanic CSV file)
Data Cleaning (Removing , filling NaN , Removing columns an duplicates)
Exploratory Data Analysis
Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn




CONCLUSIONS:


1.More people overall were non-survivors
2. Found that the passenger classes  had a correlation with fare prices
3. The cheapest class (Passenger Class 3) had the least survivors in comparison to Passenger Class 1 & 2
4. Analyzing sex, males were less likely to survive ,compared to females
5. The Age Distribution normalised from ages 20- 35, meaning that these were the most common agesd that were on the Titanic
